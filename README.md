# capsid-chat-bot
A chatbot that answers questions about a list of URLs using GPT-3 and langchain. In this case I gave it a list of URLs from 217 Capsid &amp; Tail blog posts, which it split into chunks, vector-embedded using langchain, and fed into gpt-3. I followed this tutorial: https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/build-q-and-a-bot-of-your-website-using-langchain/
